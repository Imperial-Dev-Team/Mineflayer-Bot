    'This group (Imperial Empire) was created in the early stages of the rusher war, we were created on 2b2t but slowly moved to other servers as the queue pushed us back. [1:3] A popular clone server called “Reconnect Revolution” is where we first settled. The server has 10 players max (similar to newfag.tk) with no dupes enabled but the rail dupe (which nobody knew back then). The group was created before 2016, but no members from this time exist or can vouch, the stories from that time have no evidence of the existence or very limited evidence. The following is the modern Imperial Empire. ',
    'The Imperial Empire started out as a base 2k from spawn. The base was on the highway and was made from stone and cobblestone.',
    'The original Imperial City, a very small version, It was small but had massive walls surrounding it, built by better places.',
    'After the base was griefed the Emperor at the time (lego) decided to move to 16k and build a larger base there.',
    'This base was not griefed for a month and surprisingly lasted a long time.',
    'The base contained many structures and buildings which would become recognisable imperial works. This is the base I (merick) moved into.',
    'The base was griefed yet again. We moved out to 400k have we created “Shitty city” a base made by the community which the Imperials took over quickly.',
    'A bribe is seen as a charm by the one who gives it; they think success will come at every turn.',
    'The base was created by an unknown user but the base was fairly large and had many Imperials at it.',
    'The base was never found but it was abandoned.',
    'At the time after the server gaining slightly more popularity the servers first “anti-imperial” group was created. This group was created to destroy the Imperial Empire.',
    'After finding this out, the Imperial high ranking members called a senate and convinced Lego to inside their group.',
